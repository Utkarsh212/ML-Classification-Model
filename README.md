# ML-Classification-Model
Applying ML Classification algorithms on the Glass Identification Data Set and getting inferences from the data.

The Glass Identification Dataset from UCI machine learning repository is a classification dataset.
The study of classification of types of glass was motivated by criminological investigation. At the scene
of the crime, the glass left can be used as evidence, if correctly identified. This dataset contains attributes
regarding several glass types (multi-class).
